The nearest neighbor suspect spectral library is a spectral library that was created in a data-driven fashion by propagating annotations from hundreds of millions of public mass spectra to molecules that are structurally related to previous reference molecules using MS/MS based spectral alignment.
It is a freely available resource provided through the [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/) platform to help investigators hypothesize candidate structures for unknown MS/MS spectra in their untargeted metabolomics data.
